Description: write a program that caluclates the average of four test grades and print out that average 
Algorithm: 1. Define four constant variables for test grades 
2. Calcualte and store the average of these grades in a flaot variable: gradeAverage
3. Print out the gradeAverage
*/

// Define four constant varibles
let grade1: Float = 88.8 
let grade2: Float = 90.0
let grade3: Float = 87.0
let grade4: Float = 0.0

// Calculate and store the average of these grades in gradeAverage 
let gradeAverage: Float = (grade1 + grade2 + grade3 + grade4) / 4.0

// Print out the grade average 
print(gradeAverage)
